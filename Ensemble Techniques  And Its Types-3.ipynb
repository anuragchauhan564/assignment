    "Ans : The Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms inherent to its design.\n",
    "      Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and anomalies \n",
    "      rather than the underlying patterns. Here's how a Random Forest Regressor mitigates this risk:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Random Subsampling of Data: Each tree in the Random Forest is trained on a random subset of the training data,\n",
    "           which is typically done by bootstrapping (sampling with replacement). This means that not all data points are \n",
    "            used to train each tree. As a result, the trees are exposed to different subsets of the data, reducing the \n",
    "            likelihood of memorizing noise and promoting diversity among the trees.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        2. Random Subset of Features: When constructing each node of a decision tree within the Random Forest, only a\n",
