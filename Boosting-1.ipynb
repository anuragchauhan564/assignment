    "       Here's how AdaBoost updates the weights of misclassified samples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Initialization of Weights: Initially, each sample in the training set is assigned an equal weight, \n",
    "        typically \n",
    "        wi =1/n, where n is the total number of samples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Weak Learner Training: A weak learner is trained on the weighted training data, and the predictions\n",
    "       are compared with the true labels to determine the misclassified samples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Exponential Loss Calculation: The exponential loss for each sample is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "        L(y,f(x))=e^−yf(x)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        where y is the true label and f(x) is the prediction from the weak learner. The misclassified\n",
    "        samples receive higher exponential loss values.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. Calculation of Error and Alpha: The total error of the weak learner is computed as the sum of the weights\n",
    "       of the misclassified samples. An alpha value is then calculated based on the error to represent the \n",
    "        contribution of the weak learner in the final prediction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Weight Update for Misclassified Samples: The weights of the misclassified samples are updated as follows:\n",
    "        wi =wi ∗e^α\n",
    "        The exponential term increases the weights of the misclassified samples, amplifying their influence\n",
    "        in the subsequent iteration.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    6. Normalization of Weights: After updating the weights, they are normalized to ensure that they sum \n",
    "       up to 1, maintaining the concept of a probability distribution."
