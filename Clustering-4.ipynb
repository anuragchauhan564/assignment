    "    \n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "        1. Intuitive Interpretation: The Silhouette Coefficient provides a straightforward interpretation, with\n",
    "           values ranging from -1 to 1. Higher values indicate better clustering, where data points are closer to\n",
    "            their own cluster centroids compared to centroids of other clusters.\n",
    "        2. Considers Both Cohesion and Separation: The Silhouette Coefficient takes into account both the cohesion \n",
    "           within clusters (average distance between a point and other points in the same cluster) and the separation\n",
    "           between clusters (average distance between a point and points in the nearest neighboring cluster). This \n",
    "        makes it a comprehensive metric for evaluating clustering quality.\n",
    "        3. Applicable to Different Types of Clusters: The Silhouette Coefficient can be applied to clusters of different\n",
    "           shapes and sizes, as it measures the compactness and separation of clusters without making assumptions about their geometry.\n",
    "        4. No Assumptions about Distribution: Unlike some other metrics, the Silhouette Coefficient does not assume any\n",
    "           specific distribution of data points within clusters, making it suitable for a wide range of clustering algorithms and datasets.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Disadvantages:\n",
    "        1. Sensitive to Outliers: The Silhouette Coefficient can be sensitive to the presence of outliers or noise in the\n",
    "           dataset. Outliers may artificially inflate the distances between points, affecting the silhouette scores and \n",
    "            potentially leading to misleading interpretations of clustering quality.\n",
    "        2. May Favor Convex Clusters: In datasets with non-convex clusters or clusters of irregular shapes, the Silhouette\n",
    "           Coefficient may not always capture the true underlying structure effectively. It tends to favor compact and\n",
    "            well-separated clusters, which may not always be representative of the data.\n",
    "        3. Does Not Consider Cluster Density: The Silhouette Coefficient does not explicitly consider the density of\n",
    "           clusters. It treats all points within a cluster equally, regardless of their local density. This can be a\n",
    "            limitation when dealing with datasets containing clusters of varying densities.\n",
    "        4. Requires Distance Metric: The Silhouette Coefficient relies on a distance metric to compute distances\n",
    "           between data points. The choice of distance metric can affect the silhouette scores and may need to be \n",
