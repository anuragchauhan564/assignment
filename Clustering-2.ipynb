    "Ans : Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning to group \n",
    "     similar data points into clusters based on their proximity to each other. Unlike other clustering \n",
    "     techniques such as K-means or DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters \n",
    "     to be specified beforehand. Instead, it creates a hierarchy of clusters that can be visualized as a dendrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Here's how hierarchical clustering works and how it differs from other clustering techniques:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Agglomerative vs. Divisive:\n",
    "        - Hierarchical clustering can be categorized into two main types: agglomerative and divisive.\n",
    "        - Agglomerative hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively \n",
    "          merges the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster remains. It builds up the hierarchy from individual \n",
    "          data points to a single cluster.\n",
    "        - Divisive hierarchical clustering begins with all data points in one cluster and recursively divides them into\n",
    "          smaller clusters until each data point is in its cluster. It breaks down the hierarchy from a single cluster \n",
    "          to individual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Hierarchy of Clusters:\n",
    "        - Hierarchical clustering produces a dendrogram, which is a tree-like structure that represents the sequence \n",
    "          of cluster mergers or splits. The dendrogram visually displays the hierarchical relationships between \n",
    "          clusters and can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters by cutting the tree at a certain level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. No Predefined Number of Clusters:\n",
    "        - Unlike K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters K \n",
    "          beforehand. Instead, it creates a complete hierarchy of clusters that can be explored at different levels of granularity.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. Proximity-based:\n",
    "        - Hierarchical clustering relies on proximity or similarity measures (e.g., Euclidean distance, correlation)\n",
    "          to determine the distances between data points and clusters. It merges or splits clusters based on these \n",
    "          proximity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Cluster Shape and Size:\n",
    "        - Hierarchical clustering does not make assumptions about the shape or size of clusters. It can identify \n",
    "          clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes, making it more flexible than methods like K-means, which assume\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. Perform Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "            - First, apply hierarchical clustering to the dataset using an appropriate distance metric and linkage\n",
    "              method. The choice of distance metric and linkage method depends on the characteristics of the data\n",
    "              and the desired clustering outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Visualize the Dendrogram:\n",
    "            - Visualize the resulting dendrogram to inspect the hierarchical structure of the clustering. The\n",
    "              dendrogram provides insights into the relationships between clusters and can help identify clusters\n",
