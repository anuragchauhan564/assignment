    "Ans: Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "    1.Ordinal Encoding is a technique where each unique category is assigned a numerical value based on \n",
    "      their order or rank. The assigned values carry information about the order or relative positions of \n",
    "      the categories.\n",
    "    2. Ordinal Encoding is suitable when there is a clear ordering or rank among the categories.\n",
    "    3.For example, in the \"color\" feature with categories \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" label encoding\n",
    "      might assign values like 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Label Encoding:\n",
    "    1.Label Encoding is a technique where each unique category is assigned a numerical label arbitrarily. \n",
    "      The assigned values do not carry any inherent order or meaning.\n",
    "    2.Label Encoding is suitable when there is no natural ordering or ranking among the categories, and the \n",
    "      numerical values are used simply as identifiers. It is a straightforward method to convert categorical data into numerical format.\n",
    "    3.Example of when to choose one over the other:\n",
    "        Let's consider a dataset with a \"Size\" feature that represents clothing sizes. The possible categories are \n",
    "        \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large.\" In this case, the categories have a natural order, as \"Small\" < \"Medium\" < \"Large.\" Here, \n",
    "        ordinal encoding would be appropriate because it captures the order of the sizes and allows the algorithm to understand that \n",
    "        \"Large\" is larger than \"Medium\" and \"Small.\""
