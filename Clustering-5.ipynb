    "Ans : Using accuracy as the sole evaluation metric for classification tasks has several limitations, primarily \n",
    "      because it does not provide a complete picture of the model's performance. Here are some of the key limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Imbalanced Datasets: Accuracy may not be an appropriate metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where \n",
    "       the number of instances in different classes varies significantly. In such cases, a classifier can achieve \n",
    "       high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class, while performing poorly on minority classes.\n",
    "    2. Misleading Performance: Accuracy can be misleading when the cost of misclassifying different classes varies\n",
    "       significantly. For example, in medical diagnosis, misclassifying a patient with a severe condition as healthy \n",
    "       (false negative) might have more serious consequences than misclassifying a healthy patient as having a \n",
    "       condition (false positive).\n",
    "    3. Class Distribution Shift: Accuracy may not reflect the model's performance when the class distribution in\n",
    "       the test data differs from that in the training data. If the model was trained on a dataset with a certain \n",
    "        class distribution but is tested on a dataset with a different distribution, accuracy may not accurately\n",
    "        represent its performance.\n",
    "    4. Multiclass Problems: Accuracy might not provide insights into the model's performance on individual classes\n",
    "       in multiclass classification problems. It treats all classes equally, which may not be suitable when some \n",
    "        classes are more important or more difficult to predict than others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To address these limitations, various alternative evaluation metrics and techniques can be used:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These metrics provide insights into the classifier's performance beyond\n",
    "           accuracy, especially in the presence of class imbalance. Precision measures the proportion of correctly\n",
    "            predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive, while recall measures the \n",
    "            proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all actual positive instances. The F1-score\n",
    "            is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.\n",
    "        2. Confusion Matrix Analysis: Examining the confusion matrix allows for a detailed understanding of the types \n",
    "           of errors made by the classifier. This can help in identifying specific areas for improvement and adjusting\n",
    "            the model or the training process accordingly.\n",
    "        3. ROC Curve and AUC-ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) \n",
    "           provide a comprehensive analysis of the classifier's performance across different thresholds. They are \n",
    "           particularly useful for binary classification problems and can help in selecting an appropriate threshold\n",
    "           for making predictions.\n",
    "        4. Cost-sensitive Learning: Incorporating the costs of misclassification into the evaluation process allows\n",
    "           for more informed decision-making. Cost-sensitive learning techniques adjust the model's predictions based \n",
    "            on the misclassification costs, ensuring that the model optimizes its performance with respect to these costs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    By using a combination of these metrics and techniques, one can gain a more nuanced understanding of the model's \n",
    "    performance in classification tasks and make more informed decisions regarding model selection, optimization, and deployment."
