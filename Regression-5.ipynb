    "Ans : Advantages:\n",
    "     1.Feature Selection and Coefficient Shrinkage: Elastic Net combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge by performing \n",
    "        both feature selection and coefficient shrinkage. This makes it well-suited for high-dimensional datasets with many\n",
    "        potentially irrelevant or correlated features.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2.Handles Multicollinearity: Elastic Net's L2 regularization component (Ridge) helps handle multicollinearity by reducing the impact of\n",
    "       correlated predictor variables. This is especially valuable when you have features that are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3.Flexibility in Regularization: Elastic Net introduces a hyperparameter, the mixing parameter, that allows you to control the balance\n",
    "       between L1 and L2 regularization. This enables you to fine-tune the model's behavior based on the problem's characteristics and \n",
    "       the trade-off you want between feature selection and shrinkage.\n",

    "    4.Robustness: Elastic Net's combined regularization approach tends to be more stable and robust than Lasso or Ridge alone.\n",
