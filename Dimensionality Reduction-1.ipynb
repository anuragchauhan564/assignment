    "        - Information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion \n",
    "          (BIC), can be used to balance model complexity and goodness of fit. These criteria penalize models with \n",
    "          a higher number of dimensions, favoring simpler models that explain the data adequately without overfitting.\n",
    "        - Models with lower AIC or BIC values indicate better trade-offs between goodness of fit and model complexity,\n",
    "          providing guidance on selecting the optimal number of dimensions.\n",

    "        - Splitting the data into training and validation sets and evaluating model performance on the validation set \n",

    "        - Consider the specific requirements and constraints of the task at hand. For example, in classification tasks,\n",

    "        - Domain knowledge and insights about the underlying data distribution can also inform the selection of the \n",
    "          optimal number of dimensions, taking into account relevant factors such as data sparsity, feature correlations,\n",
    "          and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data.\n",

    "    6. Visual Inspection and Interpretability:\n",
    "        - Visualization techniques, such as scatter plots, heatmaps, or t-SNE visualizations, can provide insights into\n",
    "           the structure of the reduced-dimensional space and help assess the interpretability of the dimensions.\n",
    "            Selecting a dimensionality that facilitates meaningful interpretation of the data patterns may guide the\n",
    "            choice of the optimal number of dimensions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Overall, determining the optimal number of dimensions for dimensionality reduction involves a combination of \n",
    "    empirical evaluation, model selection techniques, domain knowledge, and task-specific considerations. By \n",
    "    systematically evaluating model performance and considering relevant factors, one can identify the number\n",
