    "Ans : Regularized linear models, such as Ridge regression and Lasso regression, are powerful techniques for regression\n",
    "      analysis, but they do have certain limitations that may make them less suitable or not always the best choice in \n",
    "      some situations. Let's explore some of the limitations:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1.Interpretability: Regularized linear models can shrink the coefficients of less relevant features towards zero,\n",
    "          effectively performing feature selection. While this can be advantageous for model simplicity and predictive \n",
    "        performance, it may lead to a loss of interpretability. In some cases, you may need a model with all features explicitly\n",
    "        included to gain insights into the relationships between predictors and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.Feature selection bias: Lasso regression, with its L1 norm penalty, tends to set some coefficients to exactly zero, \n",
    "          effectively removing those features from the model. While this feature selection can be beneficial when dealing with \n",
    "          high-dimensional datasets, it may lead to a biased model if some important predictors are mistakenly excluded due to high\n",
    "          correlation with other features.\n",
    "        3.Model tuning complexity: Regularized linear models require tuning the regularization parameter (λ) to strike the right balance\n",
    "          between bias and variance. Selecting an appropriate value for λ can be challenging and may require using cross-validation, \n",
    "            which increases the computational complexity.\n",
    "        4.Outliers and robustness: Regularization techniques, especially Ridge regression, can be sensitive to the presence of outliers.\n",
    "          Outliers can influence the model's penalty term and affect the regularization process. In such cases, robust regression techniques\n",
    "            or alternative approaches may be more appropriate."

    "                RMSE is more sensitive to outliers due to the squared term, meaning it may give significant weight to large errors. \n",

    "                MAE is generally more interpretable than RMSE as it represents the absolute average error, making it easier to explain\n",

    "                higher cost in real-world consequences, it may be more critical to minimize that specific error, and the choice of metric\n",
    "                would be driven by the application requirements."
