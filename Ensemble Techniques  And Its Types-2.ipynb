    "Ans : Advantages of Using Different Types of Base Learners:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Diversity of Models: One of the primary advantages of using different types of base learners is that it introduces \n",
    "          diversity into the ensemble. Each base learner may have different strengths and weaknesses and may perform well on\n",
